# Geotab Intersection Congestion Prediction

Intersection Congestion provides information gathered from commercial vehicle telematics devices.It includes aggregate stopped vehicle information and intersection wait times. 
Possible use cases include(Geotab website): 
A city can use the data to analyze congestion and light timing issues at scale across the region, and evaluate for impact or potential impact of infrastructure changes. 
NGOs can use the data as part of research into emissions and pollution. 
Fleet managers can use the information on traffic congestion at intersections as a factor to support optimal routing decisions.

In this project, we use intersection details of Philadelphia city. Aim of this project is to make use of the amazon sagemaker service to predict congesion by aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times.
